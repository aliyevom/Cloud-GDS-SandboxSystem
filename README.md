| **iOS App & API Gateway**         | - The iOS App sends requests to the API Gateway for various services, such as retrieving data, uploading files, and executing predictions. <br> - The API Gateway routes requests to Airline APIs, interacts with the Hash Service, connects to File Storage, and manages communication with the Employee Gateway for authentication and user management.                                                                                      | Swift, UIKit, AWS API Gateway, REST, gRPC | - User authentication <br> - Interaction with training modules <br> - Secure communication with backend services <br> - Request routing <br> - Load balancing <br> - Security enforcement <br> - Integration with other services           |
| **Airline APIs & Employee Gateway** | - The API Gateway communicates with these APIs to retrieve and update data as needed. <br> - The Employee Gateway works closely with the API Gateway to authenticate user requests and enforce access control policies. | REST, GraphQL, OAuth2, JWT, LDAP     | - Data retrieval <br> - Real-time updates <br> - Integration with third-party airline systems <br> - Authentication <br> - Role-based access control <br> - User session management                                                            |
| **File Storage & Hash Service**   | - The API Gateway routes file upload/download requests to the File Storage service. <br> - The Hash Service interacts with the File Storage service to verify the uniqueness of files before storage. <br> - The API Gateway uses the Hash Service to maintain data consistency.                                                                                                                                                                        | AWS S3, Amazon RDS, EFS, AWS Lambda, SHA-256, DynamoDB | - Secure file storage <br> - Version control <br> - High availability and scalability <br> - Data de-duplication <br> - Integrity checks <br> - High-performance hash generation and verification                                                |
| **Machine Learning Service & Real-time Predictions** | - The Machine Learning Service processes data from various sources to generate predictions. <br> - The results are sent to the Real-time Predictions service for immediate analysis. <br> - Works with Role-based Access Control to ensure that predictions are only accessible by authorized users.                                                                                                                                       | AWS SageMaker, TensorFlow, PyTorch, AWS Lambda, AWS Kinesis, Kafka | - Predictive analytics <br> - Model training and deployment <br> - Continuous learning and adaptation <br> - Real-time data processing <br> - Prediction distribution <br> - Integration with downstream services                            |
| **Role-based Access Control, TLS Encryption, ID Tokens & Reinforcement Learning** | - Role-based Access Control utilizes TLS Encryption to secure communications and works with ID Tokens to authenticate and authorize user access. <br> - Reinforcement Learning integrates with the Role-based Access Control to dynamically adjust permissions, using system feedback to improve future predictions and security measures.                                                                 | OAuth2, JWT, AWS IAM, RBAC, AWS ACM, OpenSSL, AWS SageMaker, TensorFlow, PyTorch | - Access management <br> - Policy enforcement <br> - Integration with machine learning for adaptive access control <br> - Data encryption <br> - Secure communication <br> - Certificate management <br> - Adaptive security policies        |
